# UI Design

These notes are all about UI design. 
I don't know anything at all about design, so the notes are about the basics.

## White Space

- White space is the empty space between elements. 
- It gives the user interface some structure and makes it look better.
- In CSS, paddings and margins can be used to add white space.
- Try to use equal white space inside of containers.

## Alignment

- Alignment is the process of making sure that every element is positioned correctly.
- If your elements aren't aligned well, your design may look a bit weird.
- Each element in a user interface defines a series of rows and columns. The rows and columns show the alignment and location of elements.

## Contrast

- Contrast is defined as being in a strikingly different state from something else.
- All elements have contrast compared to the background color.
- The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0's Minimum AA guidelines recommend having a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for the visual presentation of text and images of text, except for large text which should have a contrast ratio of 3:1.
- The Enhanced AAA guidelines recommend the ratio of 7:1 for the visual presentation of text and images of text, except for large text which should have the contrast ratio of 4.5:1.
- There are browser plugins, websites, and UI design application plugins that can check contrast.
- You don't need to always use black to increase contrast.
- You don't necessarily need a lot of contrast for containers.

## Scale

- The scale of every element has to be carefully considered.
- Make sure that elements aren't too small.

## Typography

- Getting typography right means that you must consider font size, visual hierarchy, alignment, line height, font styles, color, contrast, letter spacing, line height, and font choices.
- So, good typography takes into account other design fundamentals.
- Try not to use more than two font families. You can usually use just one.
- Serifs work well with sans serifs.
- Use visual hierarchy to style important elements to be more obvious (ex: larger).
- Use line height to make the text easier to read.
- Use color and contrast to either emphasize or deemphasize text.

## Color

- Color is often the first thing that people notice when they visit a website.
- Color psychology describes the feelings and meanings that a certain color elicits.
- Green is associated with wealth, nature, and growth.
- Black is associated with luxury, sophistication, and elegance.
- Certain colors mean different things to different cultures and people.
- Don't use too many colors.
- Make sure colors complement each other.

## Visual Hierarchy

- Visual hierarchy establishes the level of importance for elements.
- Visual hierarchy can be established through the other UI fundamentals.
