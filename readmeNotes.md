# README Notes

I typed up these notes while learning from a Udacity course about writing READMEs. 
(Link: [https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777))

- start with a description (and possibly a logo)
- keep it clean and easily readable
  - ex: use bullet points and section headers
- be detailed and clear
- include everything that's required for understanding the code 
  - ex: libraries, installation, usage, and known bugs
- Don't make assumptions
- choose a license 
- use Markdown
- What steps need to be taken?
- What should the user have installed and configured?
- What might the user have a hard time understanding?
